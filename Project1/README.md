### Introduction
Linux environment has several open challenges that need contribution from the users. The 
contribution can be on several aspects of design, writing, organizing, code, testing, patch, bug 
fixing etc. The list of challenges can be found on several forums of the Linux pages . There are 
many communities like Open Source Friday which aggregate and manage open course projects 
providing a channel for contribution management. The task here for the students is that, in a 
team of 3 to 4, each team will identify an open challenge related to operating system or its 
application and contribute to it towards improvising functionality. 
While modern operating systems have several challenges, the contribution can be on any of the 
aspects from design to testing
